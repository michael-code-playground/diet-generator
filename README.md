# Diet generator - concept

Simple project whose main objective is to facilitate decision-making process and save from the demanding dilemma which recipes to choose, considering we're faced with aboundance of cookbooks, we've accumulated in the hopes of working on our nutrition, in the form of PDF files we don't even want to open, let alone search all of them. The only thing the script expects a user to do, is enter their desired calorie intake, it then iterates through cookbooks and picks out random recipes matching the user's calorie intake. It displays results in a very comprehensive way - the user is provided with the information how many calories each meal contains, what book it comes from, and also what page each recipe is on. 

# Requirements

Based on my case, I assumed a user creates the catalog called 'NUTRITION', located on their desktop - within the folder there're seperate four dictionaries, I've named them simply breakfast, dinner, snacks, supper - each one contains PDF files with recipes suitable, according to me, for each meal.
